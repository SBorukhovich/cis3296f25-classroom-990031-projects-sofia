# Subscription Keeper
A subscription manager and splitter.
A user signs in and adds all of their personal subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, Microsoft 365 Family, Amazon) with cost and renewal information. For shared subscriptions, the user can add assign friends. It will calculate each participantâ€™s share of the cost. There is going to be a dashboard with upcoming renewals, total monthly spending, and outstanding balances. The user can send notifications to friends to reimburse their share. The product gives users a single, organized view of their digital expenses and an easy way to track and split costs.
